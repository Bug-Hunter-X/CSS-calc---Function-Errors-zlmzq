The CSS `calc()` function can sometimes produce unexpected results due to order of operations or unit mismatch issues.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly set.  Another common problem is using different units within the same `calc()` expression, such as mixing `px` and `%` without proper conversion.   Incorrect nesting of `calc()` expressions can also lead to errors.
